The palate is slightly restrained on entry, but opens up to riper notes of cherry and plum specked with crushed pepper. This blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc is approachable now and ready to be enjoyed.',\n",
              " 'Clarksburg is becoming a haven for Chenin Blanc in California. This bottling, using fruit sourced from several vineyards in the area, is balanced with just a trace of sweetness in the background (1% residual sugar). This is crisp, straightforward and blessed with notes of pear and lime. Drink it cold.',\n",
              " 'Bland, mature aromas of white fruits are on the weak side for Albariño. This feels round and oily, while briny leesy flavors lack pop and precision. A grabby aged finish is short on the free flow that this grape and region are known for. Drink immediately or wait for a newer vintage.',\n",
              " 'A wisp of bramble extends a savory tone from nose to finish on this otherwise bright bristling wine. Delicate honey tones register as off dry on the palate but balance neatly alongside flavors of freshly pressed apples and pears. The finish is marked by a touch of pencil lead. Drink now through 2020.',\n",
              " 'Lots of spearmint, coyote mint, hot licorice, ginger snaps and Dr Pepper spice up the strawberry fruit of this wine that provides a very herbal take on the grape. Oregano, marjoram, thyme and dill all make a showing on the sip, against a backbone of sweet cherry and blackberry fruit, finishing on cedar.',\n",
              " 'Baked red cherry, crushed clove, iron and rose petals make for standard aromas on this bottling, although they are fairly light and simple here. There is a sizzle of acitity on the palate, where juicy strawberry and olallieberry flavors are easy to enjoy, made more complex by graphite and cedar touches.',\n",
              " \"This wine's black cherry and plum flavors veer dangerously toward prune—no doubt a product of the exceedingly hot summer. It's creamy and supple in texture, adding just enough tobacco, vanilla and smoke for complexity. But for all the fruit and ripeness, it finishes with great elegance and precision. Drink now–2020. Imported by Acadia Imports.\",\n",
              " \"There's a touch of hot asphalt, pencil lead and miso on the nose of this first vintage from a promising, well-funded project, with dark elderberry fruit and dried dill rounding out the aromas. The palate blends a gamy beef quality with oregano, marjoram, cooked strawberry, baked blackberry and a sesame-oil character.\",\n",
              " \"Black cherry, black plum and black currant are integrated well into the fresh dill and smoke scents on the nose of this wine from one of the region's newest properties. It discloses a rich dark-chocolate sauce character on the palate as well as black-currant-jelly flavors, but most impressive is the lush, sexy and soft mouthfeel.\",\n",
              " 'From a promising new project, the nose of this wine is linear and focused, with black raspberry, black licorice, cola, wet sagebrush and rain-on-slate scents. The tactile acidity once sipped creates a fascinating soft buzz on the tongue, with flavors of dried mint, brisk raspberry and cherry tomato. Camphor and eucalyptus add intrigue on the finish.',\n",
              " 'Dark and thick in the glass, this wine shows strong but not bitter tar notes on the nose plus charred beef in a blueberry glaze, wet campfire, bourbon barrel and vanilla. The structure is massive now, gooey with thick tannins and flavors of espresso bean and condensed purple flowers. Judicious acidity ensures strong cellaring potential. Drink 2018–2027.',\n",
              " 'Ripe aromas of raisin, black plum and horsehide are pointy and peppery. On the palate, this Graciano is bold and energetic, with lifting acidity. Loud berry flavors come with strong accents of dark chocolate and bitter espresso, while the finish is long but just moderate in complexity. Drink through 2020.',\n",
              " \"Bradley Brown's appellation blend is a nice entry point to this exciting winery. This wine shows lavish smoked black currant and plum flavors, with aromatically lifting spices of anise and black pepper and a savory roast-beef element. The palate packs lots of pepper and relies on plump black cherry, boysenberry and a dark-chocolate syrup richness.\",\n",
              " 'Low-yield vines on the best parcels of the Vincens estate are the source of this wine. It is super-rich and concentrated, maybe too much in its opulent excess. The wine does have great plum and berry flavors that are generous and full in the mouth. The wine even now is still young and will be better from 2018.',\n",
              " \"More complex than the winery's appellation blend, yet also requiring time to reach full potential, this shows delicate lemon slices, honeysuckle, surf wax, pink grapefruit and a touch of coconut on the nose. The palate is grippy in texture and sizzling with mouthwatering acidity, offering lemon rind, grapefruit spritz and petrol flavors. Expect inviting nut and honey-dust flavors to emerge. Drink 2018–2034.\",\n",
              " \"The addition of 15% Petite Sirah takes this bottling to a compelling place, showing barely ripe blackberries, animal fat, smoke, black pepper and a wild clove element on the nose. It's rich and layered on the palate, where chalky tannins support black cherry, grilled beef and mint flavors. This has the bones to last awhile.\",\n",
              " 'The impact of 50-year old vines is seen in the concentrated fruit, ripe and full,  in this wine. The flavors are of fresh apricots, edged with green apples and pink grapefruit, a combination that shows both richness and great freshness. The finish is a reminder of the fine acidity in 2006.',\n",
              " \"With attractive melon and other tropical aromas, this is a Torrontés that rises above the masses. It smells great and tastes like a pure blend of lychee fruit, tangerine and honeydew melon. The palate feel is smooth and round, and the finish is dry, clean and healthy. It's everything that Torrontés should be. Drink now.\",\n",
              " 'This blend of 60% Petite Sirah, 21% Syrah, 7% Grenache, 6% Petit Verdot, 5% Tannat and 1% Viognier is tightly wound but likely to improve with time. Opened now, it offers elderberry, black currant, pencil lead and loam on the nose, with lava rock, crème de cassis and kirsch flavors slowing emerging on the palate.',\n",
              " 'This is a big, brawny expression of Grenache, Mourvèdre, Syrah and Counoise, the Grenache playing the dominant role in the blend. It coats the palate in dense raspberry and blueberry fruit, seasoned with pepper and nutmeg. A leathery touch to the texture and lifted acidity keeps it from feeling heavy or overdone.',\n",
              " \"There is an odd, piercing edge to the aromas, a mix of acetic acid and pungent herb, with a hint of diesel. Somehow it's not off-putting, just atypical. The light, tart fruit is a mix of rhubarb and cranberry, very earthy and tasting of dirt and bark in the finish. This could be quite pleasant with a hearty, rustic dish such as beef Bourgogne.\",\n",
              " \"Huge in color and extract, but also a little childish. The nose has gumball, berry jam and a touch of volatility, but after things settle it rests on bold black fruit. It's not overly rich or sweet, and the feel is sort of sinewy. Seems more about size and color than refinement and polish.\",\n",
              " \"Beaver Creek makes a variation of Fairytale every vintage and this one, sourced from Napa Valley, is 41% Merlot, 36% Zinfandel and 23% Syrah, a mix that seems to work very nicely here. The wine's Zin almost tastes as if it has mountain tannins; the wine is overall herbal and earthy, ripe and sturdy with balanced fruit.\",\n",
              " \"For an under-$15 red blend, Corte has it going on. It's rich and full, almost syrupy on the nose, with lots of oak, ink and vanilla. Shows power and packs a punch, with dark berry, chocolate and spicy flavors. A little tannic and scratchy, but with structure and framework to spare. Malbec (80%), with Bonarda and Petit Verdot.\",\n",
              " \"This delicious blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot opens with an intense, brooding fragrance of dark fruit, spice and leather. The palate delivers a concentrated black-cherry flavor that's framed by big, chewy tannins and  punctuated by spicy accents of white and black pepper, licorice and pipe. Drink 2015–2024.\",\n",
              " 'Bella Vida replaces the Abbey Ridge bottling and does so with pizzazz. The best of the 2011 releases, this is a beautiful expression of grapes grown on red clay soils, with refined, deeply penetrating flavors of ripe raspberries. Smooth, supple and long, with uncommon purity, it finishes with a kiss of chocolate from 18 months in one-quarter new oak barrels.',\n",
              " \"This huge Malbec defines jammy and concentrated. The bouquet is ripe, soft and minty, while the palate echoes the nose with thickness and density. Flavors of prune, raisin, tea and blackberry are borderline syrupy, while the finish is smooth and pure but doesn't offer much spine or foundation. Drink this modern Malbec sooner rather than later.\",\n",
              " 'This is the stud in the Acústic stable. A blend of 70% Carignan and 30% Garnacha, Braó is lively and bright on the nose, with ripe blackberry and cassis aromas. The palate is concentrated and juicy, with fine balance and bold flavors of blueberry, blackberry and coffee. A toasty, dark finish features chocolate, toast and minerality. Drink through 2019.',\n",
              " \"This wine displays ample concentration in its inky color and potent aromas of dark berry fruit. There's a hint of raisining as well. In the mouth, it's mouthfilling but lacks a bit of texture; the flavors include dark plums, vanilla and hints of dried fruits, like figs and dates. With a finish that calls to mind chocolate fudge (minus the sugar), opt for drinking this wine over the relatively near term, now to 2020.\",\n",
              " \"Deep, lush aromas of black fruits, graphite and coconut are welcoming and friendly. The mouthfeel is pure and smooth, with elegance and power. Flavors of cassis, blackberry, hard spices and licorice filter into a long, mellow, classy finish. This is a pushy, full-bodied wine that doesn't throw punches; drink through 2020.\",\n",
              " \"This wine contains some material over 100 years old, but shows no signs of fragility. Instead, it's concentrated through age and should hold in the bottle indefinitely. It's dark coffee-brown in color, with delectable aromas of rancio, dried fig, molasses and black tea, yet despite enormous concentration avoids excessive weight. And it's amazingly complex and fresh on the nearly endless finish.\",\n",
              " 'After a few minutes in the glass, this stunning wine opens up to reveal classic Nebbiolo aromas of leather, tilled soil, underbrush, fragrant blue flower and ripe berry. The juicy concentrated palate dishes out layers of succulent black cherry, crushed raspberry, anise and pipe tobacco framed in firm, velvety tannins. Drink 2022–2035.',\n",
              " 'A waft of smoky char and toasty oak provide a rich foundation and compelling entry into this one-acre vineyard-designate from the historic grower, before unleashing, slowly, a torrent of melon and fresh-cut apple with a length of intriguing nutmeg and cardamom. Medium-bodied and lush, it will remain on your palate memory a long time.',\n",
              " 'Produced from vines more than 100 years old in the heart of the Clos de Vougeot vineyard, this is an impressive wine with a long future. The wood aging is already surrounded by ripe, intense black fruits. A fresher character comes from the bright acidity of the vintage, giving the wine a lift. The aftertaste is long and concentrated. Drink from 2024.',\n",
              " 'Up the slope above the Grand Cru of Le Montrachet, this vineyard once grew hemp (hence the name, cheneve). This poised wine is both stylish and rich, with good acidity allied to ripe apple and citrus fruits, cut through the mineral texture and promise a generous wine as it ages. Drink from 2020.',\n",
              " \"As impressive as the woman—a pioneer in the Napa Valley—was herself, this 100% varietal wine from the estate property high atop Diamond Mountain is powerfully elegant, intense yet refined. It begins with a high-toned, graceful entry that's rich in blueberry and chocolate, the oak smooth and integrated, with a suggestion of hand-rolled tobacco. Drink now through 2022.\",\n",
              " 'This is an opulent wine from one of the fabled series of white Grand Crus. Along with generous yellow fruits and ripe citrus, it has weight and gravitas. Spice from the wood fills things out even more, giving the wine its balance, its intensity and its future. Drink from 2022.',\n",
              " \"For 2014, the Weber is the star of a very fine Winderlea lineup. Dark and deeply concentrated, it's jammed with black cherry fruit, annotated with anise and showing a hint of gunmetal. The tannins are ripe and taste of clean earth. This is a fine candidate for aging. Drink now through 2030.\",\n",
              " 'This wine is a blend of fruit from five different vineyards scattered across the valley. The aromas of barrel spice, black cherry, dried leaves, herbs and flowers still seem quite locked up. The flavors are generous and full with palate coating milk chocolate and cherry flavors with a finish that lingers.',\n",
              " \"Thickly moussed, Roederer's Brut, 60% Chardonnay blended with 40% Pinot Noir, aged two years on yeast is affordable and luxurious. A gorgeous, very dry sparkling wine with aromatics of honey, raisin, apple and pear, it is rich and soft and offers both depth and length. It's an ideal marriage of bright acidity and ripe fruit character.\",\n",
              " \"Morar is a spicy Amarone with a fragrance of raisin, baked plum, tobacco and black pepper. The palate delivers lush black cherry and raspberry flavors mingled with intense white pepper, clove and nutmeg notes. It's smooth and rich with enough freshness to make this a perfect match for seasoned cheeses or roasted red meat.\",\n",
              " 'Dense, dark and spicy, this opens with a thicket of briar and bramble—one almost wants to say thistle—wrapped around taut, compact black fruits. There is a hint of gun metal running through the palate, and as the wine warms and slowly opens, it reveals a lingering finish with a little pat of butter left on the tongue. This should be in fine shape for at least another decade.',\n",
              " 'This El Dorado wine opens with aromas of sweet floral jasmine and is very pretty through and through. Its acidity sings perfectly through the middle of the wine, lifting the flavors of apple and dried apricot as well as the notes of lemon and lime on the finish. This should pair with a range of midweek dinners.',\n",
              " \"This would be a straightforward Bordeaux red blend if not for the 5% Petite Sirah within. Together, it's 74% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Merlot, 7% Cabernet Franc and 2% Malbec as well, sourced from Howell Mountain and valley floor sites. Dusty and herbal, the wine is thick and sizably tannic, with dense black fruit, leather and coffee.\",\n",
              " \"From a walled vineyard once owned by the local bishop, this wine is structured and firm while also having great red cherry and berry fruit. It's one of a number of Premier Crus from this producer—and certainly the most expressive with its generous fruit and balanced tannins. Drink from 2018.\",\n",
              " 'Bob Lindquist is almost certainly the only vintner in America that is drying Marsanne on straw mats to make a dessert wine. The result is aromas of Asian pear, white peach, baked apple and baking spice, more fresh rather than sweet. It is viscous on the sip, and the sweetness steadily grows on the palate, offering cotton candy flavors. Fascinating stuff.',\n",
              " 'This is a delicate yet flavorful take on this grape, from a biodynamic, cool-climate vineyard. Light red plum and hibiscus aromas meet with sweet herbs and cinnamon spice on the nose. The lithe palate offers candied strawberry with thyme, anise and touches of garden herbs, with that red fruit flavor carrying deep into the finish. Would pair great with spicy food.',\n",
              " \"There's a whiff of volatility upon opening, then a rush of bright, tangy orange and cherry fruit. The 20% new oak aging does not really come through in scent or flavor. Though not in any way effervescent, this young release carries an impression of carbonation in the finish. Give it another year or two of bottle age and drink after 2019.\",\n",
              " \"There's an expert balance between lightly melted butter, pithy Meyer lemon and toasted marcona almond on the nose of this bottling from the region's iconic vineyard. The palate is wound up tightly, offering good grip and lots of textural length while showing flavors of chamomile, saffron, sea salt and more Meyer lemon rinds.\",\n",
              " 'One of a crop of new Oregon sparklers, this was barrel fermented with native yeast and aged for 56 months prior to disgorging. Fine tiny bubbles and a fresh, yeasty aroma introduce the wine, which has excellent concentration. Green apple and green banana, a touch of cucumber and a nice toasty frame all combine gracefully. The odds are that this will continue to improve in bottle for another five years at least.',\n",
              " 'Scott Shull (Raptor Ridge) consults here. This brings a blend of clones from the estate vineyard, with ample new wood still showing through. Black fruits and a vein of coffee are also in the mix, with a balanced, somewhat muscular mouthfeel. This has the strength to stand up to a lightly blackened grilled seafood filet.',\n",
              " 'Slightly liquorous when first opened, this pushes the alcohol up towards a place where some of the nuances are lost. But it has plenty of flavor, power and punch. Black coffee, black cherry, black olive and black licorice are entwined here, with some heat in the follow-through. Give it a good decanting and it will start to smooth out.',\n",
              " \"Bright pomegranate and dried strawberry notes start the aromas on this bottling and then descend into more brooding cola, smoked herbs, cinnamon and spicy hibiscus. There is herbal and mineral depth to the palate, with raspberry, cranberry and pencil lead flavors that evolve toward fruit punch, thyme and earth. It's light in body but full of grippy texture.\",\n",
              " 'A touch of earthy funk shows at first on the nose of this bottling, laced throughout the dark cranberry, pomegranate, crushed grapeseeds and a lavish layer of violets. The palate is heavily spiced with clove, gingerbread, a touch of juniper, lots of earthy sagebrush and a strong cranberry fruit, all seasoned by an iron-powered minerality.',\n",
              " 'From one of the more exciting and westernmost vineyards in the region, this bottling shows earthy, gamey aromas alongside ripe red and purple fruits, pairing plum and black cherry with minty, musky herbs. The palate shows dried olive, tart orange peels, red plums, baked figs and pine needles, proving deliciously savory and intense.',\n",
              " 'Strong elements of black pepper and smoky oak beg for steak to be paired with this 100% varietal wine. It showcases sizable weight and a solid tannic structure, with supple expressions of black cherry and chocolate that linger long on the rich finish. This bold beauty should hold well through 2023.',\n",
              " \"From Paso's blending vanguards, this mix of 62% Syrah, 19% Petite Sirah, 13% Cabernet Sauvignon and 6% Malbec offers an intriguing nose of sesame, soy, cracked pepper, fresh blackberry and raw beef. There is cedar and toasted pine on the palate as well as smoked meats, black pepper, teriyaki and an elderberry-blackberry base.\",\n",
              " \"This is a gorgeous wine, blended with 8% Merlot, 1% Petit Verdot and 1% Malbec, and aged entirely in new French oak. Juicy waves of cassis and red currant are accented by dark chocolate, ultimately showcasing a lush, plush yet structured palate. It's decadent now, but should age well through 2022.\",\n",
              " \"Crisp green apple is the star in this well-made, balanced and elegant wine, that's tangy yet smooth, with a voluptuous tease of anise. Approachably structured, the complexity of the texture and lurking layers of further flavor suggest letting this wine open slowly to unveil its true self, and allowing it to linger on the palate.\",\n",

This one is full bodied and rich, with dense plum and chocolate notes that verge on being fudge-like. But those elements are lifted slightly by hints of mint and bacon. Mocha joins the party on the long finish. Drink now–2025.',\n",

It smells and tastes like lemon, lime, green apple and kiwi, and has great balance.',\n",
              " \"The winery's larger bottling of the variety, one it has mastered for decades, this wine is a mix of baked plum and rustic leather notes.

Complex and long, this is a wine that will surely spark some heated discussion.',\n",

Tart acidity and a concentrated red-cherry flavor are accented with graphite and black tea notes.\",\n",
              " 'A touch of smoky petrol in the aroma and flavor adds intrigue to this full-bodied, creamy-textured wine.

Those looking for big fruit, look elsewhere.\",\n",

Aromas recall honey, honeysuckle, tart apple and pineapple, and the flavors are like orange zest—tart, crisp and slightly bitter in a good way.

              " \"A super-structured, incredibly textured Syrah from the Sierra Foothills, this is Bill Easton's best of the best lots, aptly named Ascent, that he puts out every year to showcase his deft handling of age-worthy Syrah. This one will continue to develop its earthy, dusty, bacon fat and cigar box qualities over time. A truly beautiful bottle of wine.\",\n",
              " \"Supple, dark, and laced with licorice, cassis, and clove, this well-crafted Bordeaux blend does not scream high alcohol, though it tops 14.6%. What keeps it focused and precise are the vivid acids and sculpted tannins. It's the work of a young winemaker who is improving dramatically with each new vintage, even as his vineyard puts out better and better fruit.\",\n",
              " \"Though it's a huge tannic monster right now, this Bordeaux blend, a first release and new brand name from Steven Kent Winery, is an ode to Steven Kent Mirassou's family's long lineage in California winemaking and the roots of Livermore's history in wine as well. A majority Cabernet (75%), with all the lush cassis and black cherry one would hope for, the wine shows nicely honed herbal notes from its 15% Cab Franc in the middle, with a little touch of spice on the finish coming from 5% Petit Verdot (3% Malbec and 2% Merlot round out the blend). Give this one time and it will surely reward.\",\n",
              " 'This particular bottling belongs with the very best Syrahs from this Syrah-infatuated state. A broad, toasty, full-bodied and fully realized wine, it has begun to smooth out from the extra years in bottle, but has a long life ahead. Berries, cherries, chocolate, coffee, mocha, tobacco, fungus, graphite… the flavors go and go.',\n",
              " \"From a cooler region than its Bin 28 stablemate, Penfolds' 2007 Bin 128 is a medium-bodied Shiraz that features touches of peppery spice, raspberry-cherry fruit and a darker edge of chocolate and coffee. The tannins are supple without being soft, giving this a drinking window that should extend through 2017 or so.\",\n",
              " \"Recuerdo is the house brand from the Vines of Mendoza project, which is relying on young Tupungato vineyards that expand annually. This vintage shows floral berry aromas along with Middle East spice notes of cumin and curry. In the mouth, it's sharp and hollow, like an elevator that skips floors. Clipped flavors of boysenberry are acidic, while the finish lacks substance.\",\n",
              " \"Earthy, deep and true to its Uco Valley roots; this is a very good and fairly serious Malbec that doesn't try to overstep its natural limitations. It's not too extracted or oaky but instead delivers robust blackberry, plum and caramel flavors backed by a warm, mildly oaky finish with menthol and mocha. Drink now into 2010.\",\n",
              " 'This is spicy and varietally specific, with sharp, tight, bright red berry flavors and a peppery finish. Made in a forward, fruit-powered style, it should be enjoyed while the youthful exuberance is there in full bloom. In   the very back of the finish are hints of smoked meat.',\n",
              " \"Coeur d'Alene Cellars does a fine job with Syrah. This has much the same satiny, sexy black fruit as the more expensive Opulence bottling, but it is more accessible and forward, with less power in the back end. Still, it's quite delicious, and the smoky tannins add some extra authority.\",\n",
              " \"A dark and richly spicy wine, with penetrating varietal scents of pepper and berry. The wine is tart and youthful, and along with the tangy flavors of berry and spice there is a layer of graphite and a hint of cured meat reaching into the finish. It's sappy, racy and bright, but also layered and showing ageworthy potential. Tannins just hint at green tea.\",\n",
              " \"This is a welcome return for this value Merlot after the 2004 vintage was skipped. The smooth and chocolaty flavors that consumers love are there, but they have been pulled back, letting more of the cherry fruit and subtle accents of forest floor, fungus and earth show through. It's textural, complex and thoroughly enjoyable.\",\n",
              " 'Tomero is a new line from the Carlos Pulenta group, and this one sings the tale of Salta with sincerity. You get telling acacia and lychee aromas, but none of the cheap perfume that can sometimes ruin the variety. The palate is lightly oily but linear, while the papaya, citrus and melon flavors just roll along.',\n",
              " \"An intense, forward style of Malbec. The nose oozes a mixture of mint, black-fruit extract and shoe polish, while the saturated palate is racy and just rich enough; the flavors of blackberry and plum are lively with coffee and mocha accents on the finish. A bit acidic and racy, but that won't hurt it if served with food.\",\n",
              " 'This is a dark, sappy, saturated wine, and the power and grip of the fruit belies its claim of 12.9% alcohol. The Malbec is plenty ripe without being over-ripe, and the fruit retains a certain muscularity, along with a mélange of cherries, plums, rum-soaked raisins and coffee liqueur. Thoroughly delicious and captivating.',\n",
              " \"Torres' Celeste debuted in 2003, and the '05 is the best vintage to date. The wine has penetrating berry and spice aromas and an accent of animal leather.

              " 'Full bodied and definitely fruity without being sweet, this wine from Fulcrum comes straight at the taste buds with opulent black cherry and tart raspberry flavors on a vivid texture. Having spent 15 months in French oak before bottling, it tastes a bit dense and muted at this point, and should be best after 2018.',\n",
              " 'This wine seems broad across the palate, but not quite as deep as some Condrieus. The fruit is understated, resembling gently toasted marshmallow and maybe a touch of baked pineapple, rather than flamboyant apricot and spice.

              " \"This blend of 60% Grenache, 30% Syrah and 10% Cinsault would be a crowd favorite if more than 700 cases were available in the U.S. The black cherry fruit is punched up by hints of herbs and cracked pepper, there's ample weight but great freshness and zest, and the finish is long and complex, showing off hints of licorice, pepper and dusty earth. Drink now–2020.\",\n",
              " 'This unusual varietal wine hits with a giant wall of herbal aromas that suggest tomato leaf, oregano and basil. The palate is firm and structured in feel, with smacking tannins and flavors of dark berry fruits, green herbs and coffee. A peppery tasting finish with residual green flavors and mocha works for this decidedly herbal-leaning but high-quality wine. Drink now.',\n",
              " \"This is a big, modern, warm Garnacha with a lot of oak and vanilla on the bouquet as well as blackberry and cassis.

Drink this mature white immediately.\",\n",
              " \"A blend of grapes from several vineyards, this is named for a famous jazz tune. The blending both softens and expands the mid-palate, and seems to have boosted the aging curve.

              " \"The nose on this blend of Gewurztraminer and Macabeo defines neutral; it's clean but shows little more than a whiff of apple. The palate is fresh and quick moving, with mild peach, pear, apple and melon flavors that culminate in a solid finish that's not very exciting but doesn't stray.\",\n",
              " \"This is box wine taken seriously, even featuring a picture of winemaker Denise Wordenon. Fresh-squeezed blueberry fruit mixes with black rocks, milk chocolate and cedar on the nose, followed by an easy-to-quaff juiciness on the lightly bodied palate. It's not very complex, but perfect for summer barbecues or car camping.\",\n",
              " \"“Cocina” means “the kitchen” in Spanish, and this blend of Malbec, Bonarda and Syrah is definitely a kitchen-sink type of wine.

Gets better the more you work with it, but will always register as “oaky.”\",\n",
              " 'This 2005 Syrah from Morrison Lane seems a bit lackluster compared with previous efforts. This is smoky and tight, a tannic wine with flavors of lead pencil, green tea and earth. But the fruit is quite light, tart, and does not seem to sync up with the heaviness of the tannins.',\n",
              " \"This is 100% Syrah from an excellent vineyard. It's chewy and even a bit salty in the mouth, with a mix of bell pepper and black pepper over streaks of berry and cassis. Most of the flavor is front-loaded, and the wine fades away into an earthy, fairly tannic finish.\",\n",
              " \"If all you're after is size, then sign on the dotted line. This blend is a monster that weighs in at 15.5%, so be ready for intensely sweet flavors of grape essence and licorice. To this judge, the wine has a lot of gumption but isn't what I'd want to drink glass after glass, day after day. It's lumbering, heavy but oh so sweet and dessert-like.\",\n",
              " \"This one takes on an orange tint, and the aromas are akin to chocolate, spice cake and even some baked beans. The palate is quite crisp and healthy, with berry fruit, citrus and length. A good wine with a racy, cleansing feel. It's not spectacular but it ranks highly among similar competitors.\",\n",
              " 'Lola is a 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon/Syrah blend, smooth and supple, with a mix of purple berries, black cherry, cassis and smoke. The tannins finish a little green, and the Cab/Syrah combo seems to nullify the clear, varietal expression of either grape, but overall this is a well-crafted wine that could stand nicely alongside a hanger steak.',\n",
              " \"A snappy, high-acid wine that pulses with red fruit aromas and flavors. It's sheering, which is normal for the Graciano variety, but it also tastes nice while delivering a bolt of raspberry and red plum flavor. Oak comes up late, providing a counterweight of vanilla and dry spice. Nice but like all varietal Gracianos, it's sharp and limited.\",\n",
              " 'This full-bodied wine has a big impact on the palate due to smoky, meaty flavors, very firm tannins and an overall huge personality. It starts with aromas of charcoal and charred oak, goes to ripe, rich but not sweet fruit flavors, and finishes with all that grip as well as lingering smoky nuances.',\n",
              " 'Subtle, well-balanced and rich in texture, this full-bodied wine sneaks up on the taste buds, starting with mild Bosc pear and toasted-almond aromas, then pouring richer pear, honey and hazelnut flavors onto the palate. A slight reserve in the flavors is more than offset by a quiet complexity and lingering finish.',\n",

Best after 2021.\",\n",
              " 'Hibiscus and strawberry scents make an appealing invitation on the nose of this bottling, and then light cola and pepper spice up the ante.

Aged in French and American oak for just under one year, it's labeled as a plain Oregon AVA, but it's 95% Willamette Valley fruit.

This is a classy, classic wine, with pinpoint structure and spot-on varietal character.

Notes of clean earth, clover, herb and light chocolate add depth to a core of black cherry and cassis.\",\n",
              " \"From a vineyard at the peak of the Sarmassa hill, this shows ripe berry and balsamic aromas and a hint of orange peel. The palate delivers juicy cherry flavors, mint and licorice notes, and has a firm tannic backbone. It also shows the warmth of the vintage, so it's best to drink in 5–10 years.\",\n",

Drink now–2030.\",\n",

It incorporates small additions of Zinfandel and Carignane into the whole, a picture of soft beguiling violet aromas that are followed by a velvety texture and underlying grip of tannin. Rich red fruit and a taste of licorice linger on the intense finish.',\n",
              " 'Named after an ancestor who pioneered using oak barrels for maturing Sauvignon Blanc, the wine is, of course, wood aged. It is also ripe with yellow fruits, spice and vanilla. Apricot is cut with more tangy orange zest and finished with acidity. This is a concentrated wine that is just ready to drink.',\n",
              " 'Generous oak is reflected via aromas of hickory and smoke on the nose of this lusty but refined blend of Cabernet and Malbec. In the mouth, rugged tannins and high acidity suggest further cellaring. Flavors of plum, berry, chocolate and tomato sauce finish with dry, pulling tannins and a sense of acidic freshness. Drink through 2027.',\n",

It's thick as it rolls over the palate, and the wild berry, herb and pepper flavors fit the wine's physique and profile. Long and fairly deep on the finish; drink now through 2011.\",\n",
              " 'Three vineyards contribute to this lovely wine, two in Rutherford, both certified organic, and another in Soda Canyon which is at 800-feet in elevation. Red and blue fruit open for leather and a touch of cedar and dried herb—the wine ultimately elegant and Old World. The tannin weight is substantial but never distracting.',\n",
              " 'Quite light in aroma at first, this is a delicate, lithe and lovely bottling, showing lemon and yellow pear tones on the nose. That sensibility carries to the palate, where touches of yellow apple, sea salt, faint banana and a shred of bubblegum converge for a complete yet restrained white wine experience.',\n",
              " \"Single block wines, such as this one, often show a tight focus rather than a broad palate. Here it works well, wrapping savory notes around red currant fruit. There's a lightly metallic ring to the flavors, running straight through the finish. Give this a few hours of decanting, or tuck it away for drinking after 2020.\",\n",
              " 'Farmed by the vineyard manager who owns Small Vines, another small Pinot Noir producer, this is a complex, well-crafted wine, high in acidity and high-toned red fruit, like cranberry, pomegranate and cherry, with a wisp of orange peel on their heels. Light-bodied, it finishes with black tea and mushrooms fighting for attention.',\n",

Coiled within its thickness of tannin and dense cherry are ethereal, earthy whispers of intrigue and acidity. This is a lively, lovely wine.',\n",
              " 'This medium-bodied wine has a compelling blend of restraint and power. It offers modest, fruity aromas at first, then nice tart fruit flavors that start off lean and soon expand exponentially in the mouth before tapering off elegantly on the finish. With little oak flavor in the way, it gives pure Pinot sophistication.',\n",
              " 'This wine is agile and elegant, very firm in texture without being too full-bodied. It smells lightly smoky, slightly herbal and tastes moderately rich as subtle plum and pomegranate flavors transition to richer berry and cocoa notes on the finish. It needs time to show more complexity, so drink after 2020.',\n",

A blackberry-purée flavor leads the very fruit-driven palate, which is bolstered by black pepper, violet, shaved dark chocolate and espresso bean.',\n",
              " 'The slightest shade of yellowish pink, this wine is a great study of fresh acidity and compelling texture in a rosé. Very slight and soft strawberry and squeezed lemon aromas kick off the experience, followed by light red fruit sliced by tangy kumquat on the palate. The flavors are not particularly complex or unique, but the sip is fascinating.',\n",
              " 'This wine is made from a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon, with tiny additions of Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot. A minty, menthol streak is strong on the nose, veering into almost eucalyptus, while dried herb and a shot of gunpowder provide additional savory aromas and flavors. Big tannins need time in the glass to mellow.',\n",

A firm, healthy feel isn't particularly hard or tannic, while candied berry and sweet oak flavors lead to a long, smooth finish.

Drink through 2019.\",\n",

While already deliciously accessible, it should develop some complexity in the next few years but don't hold too long. Drink through 2019.\",\n",
              " \"Opens with aromas of tomato leaf, fresh salsa and rubber. Later on red fruit enters the picture, and on the palate there's adequate raspberry and plum with a hint of chocolate. Feelwise, it's a touch gummy. But overall this wine from Patagonia is solid and proves that Argentinean Pinot Noir has its merits.\",\n",
              " \"This is quite crisp and clean, with fairly typical flavors for Washington Pinot Gris. Which is to say, not nearly as fleshy as the wines from Oregon, with less of the juicy pear character. There's plenty of acid, more like green apple than ripe pear. It's a soundly made wine, clean and fresh, but less varietally distinctive than one would hope for.\",\n",
              " \"Just a splash of Chenin Blanc has been added to the blend, adding some lift to the aromas and suggestions of citrus blossom. The natural herbaceousness of Sauvignon Blanc has been kept in check, but the wine is clean and varietal. The flavors seem just a bit muted, almost thin, but it's a perfectly refreshing, if simple effort.\",\n",
              " \"This comes from a complicated blend of Muscadelle, Loin de l'Oeil and Sauvignon Blanc: a touch from both the Mediterranean and the Atlantic.

It's enjoyable for the fruit flavor, and easy to drink due to the soft texture. The finish is lingering and almost sweet.\",\n",
              " 'Aged in new barriques, this opens with aromas of oak and oak-driven spices and a whiff of savory herbs. The palate is dominated by oak, vanilla and coffee that muffle the dried dark-cherry and mineral flavors. It has a linear quality but lacks fruit richness and is still in the vice-like grip of wood tannins.',\n",

Flavors of concentrated dark plum and white pepper are interlaced with very firm tannins. It's full bodied, young and wound up tight.

              " 'This is a well-done effort from winemaker Riaan Rossouw, which shows how engaging, inviting and refined Merlot can be. Spiced red plum and red currant aromas seductively waft over dried fern and Mediterranean herb tones. Silky, soft tannins provide just enough structure to uphold the curvacious body of ripe red plum, sweet baking spice and additional dried herbs. Amazingly, this plush wine maintains excellent acidic verve, which carries along the entire medley of flavors to a persistent fruit-laden finish. Drink now for utter enjoyment.',\n",

              " 'Earthy, stewy aromas of baked berry and tree bark are typical for this winery. This blend of 80% Malbec and 20% Cabernet is dense, layered and shows just enough acidity to stay upright. Baked, stewy flavors of blackberry, beef jerky, pepper and carob finish loamy in feel, with a touch of chocolate and herbal flavor. Drink through 2020.',\n",
              " \"This is a reserve-level blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot, given extra bottle-age prior to release. If you favor more than a hint of stem and herb in your Bordeaux-style blends, you'll find this quite interesting. Complex layers of iron, smoke, coffee grounds and cassis are in play, with a slight bitterness to the tannins. Pair it up with lamb chops right off the grill.\",\n",
              " 'Vibrant and elegant, this refreshing, mineral-driven white offers aromas of white spring flower, ripe orchard fruit and citrus blossom. Bright acidity frames the juicy pear, apple and flint flavors, while the crisp finish closes on a saline note. This is a fantastic wine from a grape grown only at the Sella & Mosca estate in Sardinia.',\n",

This estate-grown wine, from a vineyard in the valley's southwest corner, makes a solid case for more.

There's nothing simple about it; the flavors extend and expand through a wonderfully long finish.\",\n",

Drink now–2015.\",\n",

Subtle and expressive, this is the best vintage to date for the Patriarche.',\n",

Smooth as silk, it mixes berry, cherry and plum notes, with whiffs of smoke, green tea, and chocolate. Just past the stage of primary fruit flavors, it drinks beautifully, but can certainly be cellared for another decade at least.',\n",
              " 'From the acclaimed Champoux vineyard, this puts the purple fruit in a wrap of pretty baking spices. Barrel aging adds cocoa and coffee, while the acidity is sufficient to keep the wine from feeling too tannic. Another couple of years of bottle age—or brisk decanting—should put it at its peak.',\n",
              " 'Hugely ripe, this is a dense and potentially intense wine. Its high alcohol brings out a disturbing pepper character that spoils the purity of the rich fruits and mineral texture.

Velvety, it's beyond full-bodied in blackberry and chocolate, integrated in terms of oak, with a splash of black pepper and tobacco on the finish. Drink now through 2022.\",\n",
              " 'Generous aromas like ripe berries and vanilla get this full-bodied wine off to a good start.Next, the flavors chime in with harmonious blackberry, black cherry and baking-spice notes. The texture is suave and nicely tannic, and a tasty, spicy effect lasts on the finish. The wine is made with 46% Merlot, plus Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec.',\n",
              " 'Innocent Bystander has been ahead of the Moscato curve, making this wine for a number of years, and it has always been among the best from Australia.

              " \"Katnook's top Cabernet is always oaky, and the 2006 is no exception, featuring plenty of brown sugar and caramel aromas.

              " 'McCay is a producer to watch in Lodi and this wine is a perfect example of why. A blend of four different Zinfandels and Petite Sirah, it opens with a nose of baked blackberry clafouti with a bit of hazelnut and almond, a still-tight wine that with air shows a ton of structure and layered tannins.',\n",
              " 'At first, a rush of front-loaded plum and blackberry fruit hits the palate, then the flavors seem to sag a bit entering the midpalate. A wall of still-to-be-resolved oak leads into a hard, astringent, somewhat woody finish. Yet there is a substantial and well-built wine here, waiting to resolve its components into a more seamless whole. Retasted after being open a full day, it showed well, suggesting good aging potential.',\n",
              " 'This takes a page from California in its naming convention and style, which includes a good proportion of barrel-fermentation and oak maturation. Toast and vanilla frame melon and fig notes, and the midpalate is slightly creamy in texture before the wine turns crisp and lemony on the finish. Drink now.',\n",
              " \"Oak is front and center on the bouquet, and with that come accents of dried cheese and sawdust. Feels saturated, layered and tannic in the mouth, with roasted berry, black plum, herb and spice flavors.

Its tannins are more restrained than the fruit, allowing a light structure to hold up the juicy acidity and crisp aftertaste. Drink from 2017.',\n",
              " 'Structured and elegant, it opens with a fruit fragrance of black plum, wild berries and prune accentuated with hints of leather, tilled soil and spice.

Aromas of toasty oak, graphite, coffee and blackberry feed into a rugged but generous palate fueled by firm tannins.

It's 100% varietal, drawing upon equal portions of fruit from all three, and it's a magnificent combination.

Highlights of black tea, espresso and smoke add layers of interest to a lengthy finish.\",\n",
              " 'Rich, loamy and ripe smelling, this wine opens in fine form, with accents of raisin, cassis and ink. The mouthfeel is deep and balanced, while flavors of toasty blackberry, cassis and chocolate are ripe and modern.

              " 'Aromas of almond skins, pyrazines and spent white fruits struggle to draw you in. This vintage was wet and cool in Galicia, with frost issues, and this shows it. The palate is round but oily in feel, while flavors of saline water, pithy citrus and bitter melon finish peppery and soft, with low acidity.',\n",
              " \"Butter and dill are the first aromas to make themselves noticed, and below that there's raw oak and lighter-weight fruit notes. The palate shows ample resin and wood notes along with pepper and spice. It's a good wine with serious intent, but it seems a little overwooded and a tiny bit green. Cabernet Sauvignon leads the blend, with Merlot and Cab Franc filling it out.\",\n",
              " \"A little big and heavy, but that's the style that Kaiken has pushed since arriving on the market a few years ago. This version has baked-fruit aromas backed by lemon peel and espresso, while the palate is rich, dark and syrupy, but also oaky and tannic. Seems to want to offer more than it can deliver. The 14.5% alcohol level tells you that it's a big boy.\",\n",
              " \"Well priced for the quality, Chapel Hill's Shiraz-Grenache is barely a blend, with only 10% Grenache. It comes across as a nicely complex, easy-drinking Shiraz, marrying mulberry fruit with hints of chocolate, cracked pepper and fresh herbs. The texture is plush and the finish long; a super value at under $20 to drink now and over the next few years.\",\n",
              " 'New wood overwhelms the aromas, and it also dominates the palate of this wine. It just keeps on the right side of drinkability because the spice merges into pear flavors to give an intriguing nutmeg character, while the aftertaste offers freshness. The wine needs at least a year to blend together.',\n",
              " 'Smooth and sweet, like a cream Sherry is supposed to be. On the nose, this one easily shifts from ripe apricot and peach fruit to nuts and saline. The palate starts with a blast of coffee and mocha and then folds in brown sugar and spice. Sweet, long and generous, with accents of cinnamon, clove and mild chocolate. Uncomplicated, which for $13 is a virtue.',\n",
              " 'Henschke is best known for its red wines, but the 2005 Louis Sémillon shows they know a thing or two about whites as well. It combines some toasty, smoky characters with herbal notes on the nose, then develops flavors of wax, spice and citrus, lingering elegantly on the finish. Tasty now, but might develop even more interesting complexities with additional age.',\n",
              " 'The estate reserve is simply a barrel selection that the winery feels represents the top 10% of their estate-grown Pinot Noir. Basically it offers quite similar flavors; for the extra money you get more butterfat, more cherry fruit and a little less herb.

              " 'There is tons of potential for this varietal in the hot eastern reaches of Paso Robles. Light peach and Pink Lady apple aromas start off the easy-to-enjoy nose.

A gravelly minerality and rising texture on the finish complete the picture.',\n",
              " \"Sourced from a single vineyard on Oliver's North Bench, this was fermented and aged in one-quarter new French oak barrels. The time in oak has somewhat muted the snappy vitality of the fruit (some tasters might argue it has simply rounded it off).

              " \"A surprising 30% of this wine is Clairette, a white grape variety. Perhaps that accounts for the wine's apparent freshness. Hints of crushed stone mark the nose, while the ripe flavors suggest peaches and berries, tailing away slowly on the finish. Drink this mouthfilling rosé over the rest of 2017.\",\n",
              " \"This is a very light expression of the grape from a San Francisco-based producer, with thyme, chaparral, cranberry, tart pomegranate juice and wet clay on the nose. The palate shows light, tangy cherry juice, fennel, crushed olive and peppery spice. It will work well for fans of this style, but there's not enough there to entertain the mainstream Pinot Noir fan.\",\n",
              " \"Tight and nicely constructed, this is not afraid to show its herbal side. Tannins are earthy and firm, the fruit tight and focused, and the wine might benefit from a few more years in the bottle.

              " 'The 2011 and 2012 Chardonnays from DaMa are a study in contrasts, showing how very different the vintages were. Both come from Sagemoor and Conner Lee grapes, but in 2012 the wine has more floral highlights, and a vertical crispness to its structure. Flavors of anise, green apple and pear are wound up in the tight frame, and this would appear to have some years of life ahead.',\n",
              " \"The finest Gamache Cabernet Franc since the 2008, this is arguably the best value in the winery's entire lineup. There's excellent varietal character on display, a mix of blueberries and coffee grounds, and the overall balance is improved by virtue of the cooler 2011 vintage, keeping alcohol levels in check.\",\n",
              " 'A pure varietal Syrah, this opens with a mix of peppery herbs, a hint of stem, and a whiff of tomato leaf.

              " 'The proportions favor Grenache 55% to 45%. Four vineyards from three widely different AVAs contributed grapes, yielding compelling aromas of wild berry, raw meat and a brambly character.

This is fresh and focused.\",\n",

There is life force here and you know this will continue to evolve.',\n",
              " 'Flinty overtones of yeast reveal how very young this wine is. The verve that springs from the glass is undeniable. While the focus is on grapefruit and lemon zest in a tightly pulled focus, there are glimpses of honeycomb, popcorn, treacle, pollen and hints of tropicality, with a touch of pineapple. Hold this wine for a while longer and it will unfold itself graciously. Drink 2016–2020.',\n",

              " 'Dense and briary, with black and red plum notes complemented by a strong sense of clove, this wine is cushioned in tar, oak and cigar box, showing nicely resolved tannins. Blended with 16% Merlot, 4% Cabernet Franc and 2% Petit Verdot, it is enjoyable now and will cellar well for many years to come.',\n",
              " 'Seemingly effervescent aromas of lemon-lime soda, wet chalk, baking soda and apple blossom make for a very showy yet mineral-driven nose. The flavors are driven by ripe lemon and cling to a woolly line of citrus pith. The wine makes the mouth water strongly on the finish, creating an interesting sipping experience.',\n",
              " 'This nervy and vibrant wine takes time to reveal the intriguing flavors within. Quite tart and tannic at first, it is firm in texture to balance the ripe, sweet plum, marascino cherry and orange peel aromas. While chewy and lip-smacking in the beginning, deeper flavors come through on the second and third sips, and a smoky nuance develops on the finish.',\n",
              " 'This is a heavy-duty Cabernet, big in every way, with rich black cherry and cassis fruit, and dense, dark tannins. The long, slightly grainy finish reinforces the impression of raw power, yet the wine retains perfect proportion and is nicely differentiated from the other 2010s crafted by winemaker Chris Figgins.',\n",
              " \"Leonetti's 2010 Reserve includes 52% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, 9% Cabernet Franc and 9% Malbec—a more complex blend than the 2009. It opens with a lovely floral aroma—a bouquet of clover and white flowers—then heads for the dark side, with black cherry and cassis. It's a big, tannic wine, beautifully crafted, and clearly differentiated from the winery's regular Cabernet bottling.\",\n",
              " 'Black and viscous, this gorgeous Petite Sirah is intriguing in every way. Opening with aromas of just-muddled mint and freshly baked bread, this wine tastes as if wildflowers and brambly blackberry stems were placed carefully in a leather satchel. No doubt this Petite will get even more interesting with age.',\n",
              " \"All Leonetti wines are 100% estate-grown fruit, mixing Seven Hills, Mill Creek Upland and Loess vineyard grapes. The 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon includes 12% Merlot, 8% Petit Verdot and 4% Carmenère in the blend. Young and chewy, with a hint of herbaceousness, this shows lovely balance and a mix of raspberry, black cherry, cassis, coffee and cacao. It's a young, deep and powerful wine that will certainly reward cellaring.\",\n",
              " \"This exceptional wine was made by the late David Lett to celebrate the birth of his granddaughter. It's drinking beautifully, and has the color and scent of a mature wine, though Eyrie Pinots can often live longer than those who bet against them. Delicate and subtle, it nonetheless shows surpassing power and length. Mature, fully-evolved dried fruit and herb flavors are highlighted with notes of cinnamon and brown sugar.\",\n",
              " \"This is McCrea's top cuvée, and the 2008 is as good as it has ever been. Co-fermented with 8% Viognier, it starts out tight and compact, with crisp marionberry fruit and a generous wash of coffee liqueur. The acids are citrusy and fresh, and the wine has depth and an emotional range that reaches almost symphonic power.\",\n",
              " 'At the start the wine shows leafy aromas and a hint of burned rubber that eventually burns off. The lean palate is evolved, and while you can still detect a note of stewed prune, most of the fruit has dried up. It ends on a bitter, drying note of astringent tannins.',\n",
              " \"A blend of Sangiovese (42%), Merlot (32%), and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is one of the first wines coming off the estate vineyard located next to the winery. A full five years old, it's starting to show a touch of age aromatically, with notes of bittersweet chocolate, dried cherry and dried herb along with sliced green pepper. The palate shows the brightness of acidity that this region of the valley is known for, heightening the fruit flavors and stretching out the finish.\",\n",
              " 'Fresh citrus and green apple have a leafy touch and something that is reminiscent of wet stone. That taut slenderness is apparent throughout the light dry palate where lemony freshness plays the central role. The fizz is fine and creamy and leaves the mouth filled with freshness. This is vivid, has lots of verve and a clean dry finish.',\n",
              " 'There is a yeasty autolytic touch of brioche that mixes with the vivid red-apple notes of the nose which also has subtle floral overtones. The palate shows a subtle harmony of fresh tart apple, a touch of strawberry and again that tender creamy note of brioche. This lovely elegant sparkler has a very fine fizz and a very refreshing long dry finish.',\n",
              " \"This is an orange wine, intentionally oxidized and left in barrel for two years. It's very much like a fino Sherry, with comparable aromatics. What truly distinguishes this effort is the finish that lingers and develops more and more nuances for several minutes. Don't expect anything that resembles Chardonnay, but pair this with salted nuts, meats or fried foods and you will be delighted.\",\n",
              " \"Though this is one of the first wines from winemaker Jennifer Hoage's own label, it's a study of soft integration from what can be a powerful site. Cherry, allspice and rose aromas lead into a palate full of wild berry and hearty sagebrush notes, framed by pitch-perfect acidity. A light yet spicy licorice-inflected finish completes the experience.\",\n",
              " 'An unusually fresh herbal note of lemon balm hovers on the nose. The palate, however, counters this with ample honeyed sweetness. The lemon-balm note flashes here and there and the residual sugar frames notions of ripe Mirabelle plum beautifully. This will work well as a counterpoint to sharp blue cheeses with its medium-sweet finish.',\n",
              " 'Tender notes of lemon on the nose segue into riper citrus notes on the palate. This is a taut but textured wines which has a concentrated palate with an almost oily feel. Zesty lemon notes provide freshness. The finish is dry and lasting and this is sure to develop over the coming years. Drink 2017–2025.',\n",
              " 'Gorgeous fruit aromas, generous and deep fruit flavors and soft, chocolate accents add up to a very flavorful but relaxed wine. Touches of clove and cedar pop up with the second sip, while some welcome tannins clean the palate. The fruit flavors come back on the finish. It is full-bodied but very smooth.',\n",
              " 'Quite light in color, especially for the alcohol level, this wine offers dried red cherries, hibiscus, rose petals, pencil shavings and a touch of hot asphalt on the spicy and fun nose. Lots of lively red fruit energy comes forth once sipped, with nutmeg, clove spice, ginger snaps and molasses flavors rounding out a memorable pour.',\n",
              " 'This wine—the first vineyard-designate to come out of this young site—is 51% Cabernet Sauvignon, 27% Cabernet Franc and 22% Merlot. It takes time to get going but once it does, it provides generous aromas and flavors of coffee, vanilla, herbs, plum and cherry along with lightly grainy tannins. The precision and elegance the winery is known for is on full display.',\n",
              " 'This classic site provides a grippy, structured experience of juicy, leathery blackberry and black pepper. The wine also reveals a brighter, more vibrant underside of red berry, perhaps from the contribution of 5% Grenache into the mix, alongside 17% Petite Sirah. Firm, focused and full bodied, this is a delicious wine.',\n",
              " 'This winery northeast of San Diego sources from up north and experiments heavily with stem inclusion on this bottling, which shows cherry blossoms, crushed cranberries and an earthy line of anise through the nose. Plush purple fruit flavors of olallieberry and boysenberry power the medium-bodied palate, with sage and peppercorn spice throughout.',\n",
              " \"Named for one of Barossa's top vineyards, this blends fruit from Barossa, McLaren Vale, Clare Valley and Langhorne Creek into a splendid warm-climate Shiraz. It's full bodied, dense and dusty in texture, with rich dark-fruit flavors of dates, blackberries and blueberries. Hints of baking spices and mocha from the barrel-aging should integrate nicely over the next several years. Drink 2017–2025.\",\n",
              " \"This wine opens with a lovely fragrance of violet, iris, wild berry, licorice and a whiff of leather. The smooth palate doles out ripe wild cherry, cinnamon, clove, white pepper, tobacco and anise. It's impeccably balanced, with glossy tannins and fresh acidity. Already drinking beautifully, it will also age well for several years.\",\n",
              " 'This shows a combination of deep fruit flavors and a firm, tight-grained texture that make it classic in style. Black cherry and black currant flavors are wonderfully accented by impressions of pine forest and dried mushrooms. Baxter matured this wine in 100% neutral French oak barrels, so the taste is all about the Langley grapes and not new oak.',\n",
              " \"There's a warm peach ripeness on the nose of this wine from a tiny appellation north of Santa Cruz near Bonny Doon, along with aromas of kumquat, vanilla bean and sea salt. The palate shows more peach, caramelized apples and saffron, cut with a lime-juice acidity and finishing with a dollop of vanilla-butter.\",\n",
              " \"This is Renacer's first Cabernet Franc, and it's excellent. Light herb notes, fine wood and deep black-fruit aromas make for a superb entry. The palate is loaded with power, but a touch of bold tartaric acidity does stick out. Black cherry, kirsch, mocha and chocolate flavors finish amid a lush mix of chocolaty oak, related spices and deliciousness. Drink through 2021.\",\n",
              " 'This takes a few minutes to open up in the glass before revealing alluring classic Nebbiolo scents of wild red berry, sweet cake spice and a balsamic note. The palate is spot on; delivering juicy raspberry, wild cherry, black tea, ground pepper, cinnamon, chopped herb and a hint of pipe tobacco. Firm, glossy tannins and bright acidity give it an elegant structure.',\n",
              " 'This offers typical Nebbiolo aromas of dark red berry, blue flower, truffle and a whiff of game along with a balsamic note. The young palate is still tight but shows dried black cherry, clove, black pepper and tobacco while firm, fine-grained give it a solid grip. Chopped mint closes the finish.',\n",
              " \"This is another top-flight example of how good the 2012 vintage was for South Australian Shiraz. The oak here is so subtle as to not factor into the wine's scents of raspberry and cracked pepper. Hints of spice and vanilla mark the palate, gently accenting red berry fruit before ending in a flood of silky tannins. Drink now–2030.\",\n",
              " 'This Toro wine is a mindblower. The nose is exemplary: it bursts with smooth, rooty aromas of licorice, kirsch and roasted black plum. The palate is huge and tannic but luxurious, and the flavors of tobacco, cedar, lemon peel, spice and black fruit set up a finish with espresso, black cherry and a wall of tannins. Drink now through 2018.',\n",
              " 'This wine is sourced from two parcels, one planted in the 1930s and the other in the 1950s. The low dosage is possible because of the concentration and ripeness of the fruit, resulting in a sophisticated, balanced and rich wine with a lemon zest flavor, a tight, mineral texture, and a crisp finish.',\n",
              " \"Using Grenache sourced from the moderately cool Lonesome Springs Vineyard, this is slightly leafy, with notes of forest floor, blueberry and blackberry. This is the first pure Grenache ever made by Brian Carter. It doesn't just taste like a big bowl of berries; it has power and depth to spare.\",\n",
              " 'Though quite different stylistically from the 2009, this is just as good. The structure in 2010 is noteworthy for its high acid focus. There are streaks of berry and cassis, with touches of smoke and espresso. This is a wine to cellar while you are drinking up the delicious 2009.',\n",
              " \"It's rare that domestic Chardonnay is truly Chablis-like, but this delicately framed wine fits that description perfectly. Nuanced with mineral and spice notes, this has melon and apple flavors that seem to sail on a gentle sea breeze. It doesn't slam you with oak, instead it seduces with you style.\",\n",
              " 'This shows the textural depth of all the Efesté wines. A floral top note gives way to firm, dark, cassis and blackberry flavors. Light notes of herb, anise and earth are introduced and set comfortably into the lengthy finish. It has great power and flavor, with the possibility of cellaring for a decade or more.',\n",
              " 'After a waxy opening, the bouquet unveils honey and peach aromas that are totally inviting. It feels thick but not cloying, and the honeyed flavors of banana, peach and dulce de leche are a prelude to the creamy, thick and deeply layered finish. Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Albariño make the blend.',\n",
              " \"A great vintage for the Sundance Red, this is 43% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot, 18% Cabernet Franc and 14% Syrah. The addition of Syrah really livens up the mix. It's a supple, sappy, sinuous red, with rich and complex cherry and berry fruits. The 30% new oak is not only lavish for a $20 wine, but it judiciously complements all of the good fruit.\",\n",
              " 'This is a rare venture by Olivier Leflaive outside his home territory around Puligny, Chassagne and Meursault. The wine is classic Corton-Charlemagne, big and bold, a broad-shouldered wine that brings together toastiness, ripe pineapple and mango and balancing, lively acidity. It is already giving great pleasure, but should last well over the next decade.',\n",
              " 'Bold and forward, this estate-grown Syrah fairly explodes with scents of game, cured meat and smoke. The black cherry and cassis fruit forms a dense and sappy core; as the wine skips across the tongue nuances of tobacco, sweet leather, chocolate and spices come into play. It just keeps on going, adding caramel and peppery chocolate through an evolving and satisfying finish.',\n",
              " 'A beautiful, ripe wine that shows the richness of 2006 in Chablis. The wine revels in its yellow fruit flavors, apricots, peaches even pineapple, underscored by new wood flavors. Then acidity comes through, a fresh lift that leaves the wine with a clean, smooth finish. And once these initial fruits soften, the secondary flavors promise some good aging. Screwcap.',\n",
              " \"More powerful and potent than the '04, this simply has more juice, more depth, more power and more detail than any previous Sheridan wine. The fruit is exceptional—dense black cherry and cassis, with a sense of compact layering that promises great aging potential. This was 30 months in oak but does not seem oaky in any way. It already has the balance, the polish and the length to justify long-term cellaring. Tannins are ripe and supple, bringing in hints of dried herb and black olive.\",\n",
              " \"This is a mix of 56% Sagemoor and 41% Champoux Cabernet, with a 3% splash of estate Petit Verdot. It's detailed in the manner of a Pauillac, thick cassis fruit with deep veins of iron, cedar, licorice and a just a hint of silage. The fruit is dark and dense, but with breathing you'll find it begins to open into a splendid blend of black cherry, cassis and mountain berry flavor. Woodward Canyon's red wines age beautifully, but if drunk young give them a lot of breathing time.\",\n",
              " 'Jammy aromas of baked blackberry and plum are fiery at first and then flatten out with airing. A choppy palate offers a bumpy ride with ripe plum and berry flavors in front of a full-force, toasty finish that shows a strong grip courtesy of big tannins. This is two-thirds Garnacha with Syrah and Carignan.',\n",
              " \"Produced for Force Majeure by Syncline's James Mantone, this riveting wine is a blend of 47% Mourvèdre, 42% Syrah and 11% Grenache. Lush and redolent with wild berry and wet rock aromatics, it carries a thread of sweet grain along with bright, detailed berry fruit and balancing acidity. Delicious already, it can be enjoyed now through 2020.\",\n",
              " 'An attention-grabbing sense of umami introduces this wine, with darkly colored mushrooms, plum sauce, miso soup and black sage tickling the nose. There is dark chocolate with bits of espresso on the palate, which is leveled by plum skins and berry flesh, with bitter tar and black pepper on the finish.',\n",
              " \"A whirlwind of aromas—peppered black cherries, elderberry, caramel, toast, barrel smoke—rise off this appellation blend from German-born winemaker Matthias Pippig, who handcrafts small batches on Santa Barbara's Eastside. It's very soft on the palate, with medium-dark flavors of butter-crusted plum pie and an herbal note of pine pitch keeping it serious.\",\n",
              " \"Founded by a well-heeled group of wine afficionadoes, Barons has seen a change of ownership and a change in winemaking direction. For the first time, French oak has begun to supplant American oak as the barrels of choice. The wine is aromatic, detailed and inviting, with the lower alcohol prevalent in 2011. A rich mix of berry and cassis dives deeply into the palate, with dark chocolate highlights. The tannins are silky and polished, and the wine seems a sure bet to cellar well until the mid-2020's.\",\n",
              " \"Somewhat light in color, this is an aromatically appealing wine that shows a complex assortment of coffee, vanilla, pencil lead, cherry, blueberry and high-toned herbal notes. It's exquisitely polished in its styling, with plush tannins and a long, lingering finish. A pretty expression of the variety that shows a great degree of elegance and deftness, it drinks well out of the gate but continues to improve with additional time to breathe.\",\n",
              " 'The Ehrhart style is for rich wines and this impressive Grand Cru is no exception. It has intense flavors of white fruits, lemon, spice and a hint of thyme.

              " \"Pure Petit Verdot from Red Mountain's quintessential Bordeaux varietal vineyard—does it get any better? Big, deep and tannic, with lovely purity, this features ultraripe fig and plum fruit with a pleasing salinity. The finish is persistent and shows a streak of iron.

              " \"The winery's proprietary block of Zin grapes (planted in 1999) from the coveted Stagecoach Vineyards contributes to an intense wine. Juicy and oaky, it's dense in cherry and plum, a note of lavender and sage complementing the whole.

While the name “Left Bank” evokes Bordeaux, this is clearly a New World-style red, boasting bouncy fruit aromas of dark cherry and spiced raspberry, with cola and cough-syrup notes in the background. The medium-bodied palate is supported by grainy tannins, yet there's a good balance of juicy, red fruit and streaks of granite.\",\n",
              " 'Four clones, aged in 50% new French oak, constitute the heart and soul of this outstanding reserve. Redolent with a fertile mix of moist earth, compost, tobacco and floral highlights, it fills the mouth with a rich and seamless mix of plums, baked cherries and barrel notes. It leaves a tantalizing trail of mocha, toasted hazelnuts and caramel as it winds dreamily through a lingering finish.',\n",

Best from 2017 through 2024; only 100 cases made.',\n",
              " 'Year in year out, this wine is always one of the best Soaves and the 2013 is no exception.

Notes of saline and energizing mineral close the lingering finish. Drink through 2020.',\n",
              " 'Minute quantities of these rare Viogniers are produced, which is a shame, because they are distinctive and enlightening.

This begins with slightly sour aromas of yogurt and goat cheese along with shave fennel, radish, daikon and lemongrass.

              " \"Deep, dense black cherry signals immediately that this is pure, classic Dundee Hills fruit, much of it from Abbey Ridge. Average vine age is 30 years—giving it great penetration and complexity. At first tight and unyielding, it opens with scents of coffee and chocolate, and displays the thick minerality of all the winery's 2012s. Nuanced herbs add a peppery kick to the finish.\",\n",

              " \"More yellow than Lustau's manzanilla, Jarana is a lovely, proper fino with a nose of iodine, lemon blossom and popcorn. The palate is staunch and doesn't back down; the high-toned nut and citrus flavors seem classic and elevated. And the finish is intense and frames everything in walnut oil and toast.\",\n",
              " \"Young and fresh, this 100% Malbec has tight, spicy, peppery fruit that leads into a surprisingly long finish. It's not tricked up with oak, but the sharp young berry flavors evolve in the mouth and bring on clove, wintergreen and mint, which resonate through a lingering finish. Though the fruit lacks flesh, it doesn't hold back on pure flavor, and promises good things ahead for this new vineyard.\",\n",

              " 'Few wineries in Argentina make more individual wines than Achaval-Ferrer. And while some are great, others leave you scratching your head or wanting something different. This one has a deep hue but a strange mix of herbal, floral aromas that hint at air freshener. The palate is quite acid-driven and downright sharp, with pounding blueberry and kirsch flavors. More austere and tangy than we prefer.',\n",
              " \"The only thing that makes this a gran reserva is the label and the winery's commitment to a big, extracted, heavily oaked wine. It's black as ink but clumsy as can be. Smells and tastes like shoe polish, resin and oily fruit. Not what we're looking for from Argentina, or anywhere for that matter. Barely acceptable. Imported by Carolina Wine Brands USA.\",\n",
              " \"This is the first Torrontés from Pascual Toso that we've rated, and if it's any indication of what's going on there, then we say stick to the reds.

              " 'A rare grape in Oregon, this is a bright garnet shade and scented with cranberry and raspberry fruit. Acidity brings significant snap to the flavors, so much so that for many tasters it will show best with some greasy/smoky grilled meats. A hint of Band-Aid comes up in the finish, but does not distract.',\n",
              " \"This one-barrel bottling is quite intriguing, offering unexpected aromas and flavors. An element of crunched grapeseeds and unfermented wine grapes mixes with licorice, olive and pepper on the nose. A similar sense pervades the palate, along with light coffee and brown tea flavors. It's slightly odd, but also an interesting change of pace.\",\n",
              " 'Tannins form a dark barrier to start this wine. It is still young, dense with chocolate as well as fruit flavors, showing the bitter, tough flavors that come from too much extraction. The fruit will hopefully come through and soften the tannins and bring out the richness. Drink from 2018.',\n",
              " 'One of the more reliable, affordably priced Rhône blends in the state, this mix of 43% Grenache, 34% Syrah, 15% Mourvèdre and 8% Counoise offers slightly shy aromas of black and red licorice, red currant and cinnamon candy, tucked behind a layer of slate. The palate is more simplistic, with purple fruits most prevalent.',\n",
              " 'This Catalonian blend is a concentrated number with a narrow, fruit-forward nose and cheesy leather on the side. The palate is full, grabby and ripe; flavors of blackberry and cassis are jammy and dark. It finishes sweet in flavor and ultraripe in feel, with a syrupy aftertaste. Another year or two in bottle will help this settle down; drink through 2020.',\n",
              " 'The flinty silex soil is reflected in the steely flinty texture of this wine. It lies under the crisp and nervy white and citrus fruits. The result is a wine that is under tension, still young and needing time to open up with its full potential. Drink from late 2018.',\n",

Concentrated and chewy on the palate, it offers ripe black cherry, raspberry jam, clove and cocoa flavors framed by velvety, polished tannins. Thanks to its fruit richness, it's not overwhelmed by the warmth of evident alcohol. Enjoy through 2021.\",\n",
              " 'Delicate in aromas of honeysuckle, Asian pear, Gravenstein apple and a smoky butter element, this shows that quality Chardonnay can indeed succeed in this warmer region of Southern California.

Hints of toasted oak and sweet spice add depth, lingering on the finish alongside touches of straw and orange peel. Complex and layered, it's approachable now but should evolve well through 2018.\",\n",
              " \"An exuberant boysenberry jam aroma and richly layered berry and dark chocolate flavors give lots of taste pleasure to this full-bodied and impressively textured wine.

              " \"The blend is 55% Grenache, 25% Shiraz and 20% Mourvèdre, but while this is a full-bodied wine, it's not overdone or bombastic.

              " \"Temecula veteran winemaker Phil Baily has cracked the code on making fresh whites in the region's hotter climes, and this blend of 64% Sauvignon Blanc and 36% Sémillon is a stellar example.

Bright acidity carries them into the finish.\",\n",

              " \"A year's wood aging has left its mark on this wine in the form of burnt smokiness. However, the fruit is rich and full-bodied giving the promise that the wine will smooth out its rough edges. There already is a fine juiciness at the end that comes with great acidity.\",\n",
              " \"Lush, composed and fresh on the bouquet, with blackberry and perfect prune aromas. This is mouthfilling and smooth, with a firm, flush tannic structure and flavors of coconut, lemon rind, herbal black fruit and red berry.

              " 'Bold as always, with a ton of cedar, graphite, blackberry, vanilla and coconut notes on the nose. This is huge, tough and ripe, with massive blackberry, café mocha and vanilla flavors. It finishes hard but with a cascade of sweet fruit, marshmallow, coconut cake, herb and vanilla. Needs a few more years to settle. Drink after 2013.',\n",

It's full bodied and round, richly but finely textured and very drinkable now yet with the substance to age up to 10 years or more.\",\n",
              " \"Bramble and brine are present on the nose, and while 2005 was a very good vintage in Rioja, this wine brings a little less than expected.

The finish has some thickness and a slight sticky feel, but ample acidity throughout renders it a good, brisk drink.\",\n",
              " \"Sometimes concept exceeds the wine itself, and this may be a case in point. The blend is odd, and the fact that each grape comes from a different part of Spain is potentially more odd. As for the wine, it has a nice perfume to it, courtesy of the Rhone varieties in the mix. And while the cherry/berry fruit is forward, it's maybe too sweet and basic in terms of length, structure and mouthfeel. Still, it's worth a try for the experimental tasters out there.\",\n",

The texture is plush and almost soft, and the taste is warmly luxurious.',\n",

It's a big wine all the way, but not extreme in alcohol.\",\n",
              " \"Luscious and sleek in mouthfeel, and drenched with wonderful fruit flavors, this wine is a beauty. It has ample ripe fruit flavors like boysenberry and cherry pie without being literally sweet, while a sense of quiet concentration lasts on the lingering finish.

This is the wine to go with your tri-tip.\",\n",

Blackberry fruit starts the sip and then it deepens into earth, tobacco and smoke. It's a fine study of darkness.\",\n",
              " 'Aromas of raisin and cassis lean in the direction of overripe. This is less elegant and more blocky than most bottlings of Unico, but with ripe, loamy blackberry and plum flavors, it tastes great.

A good lesson in fresh Mourvèdre.',\n",

Hints of light nutmeg and coriander mingle with stronger blackberry and black pepper in the aromas and flavors.

The flavors are textured and palate-coating, with firm tannins backing them up. Just a baby now, it has a long life in front of it. Enjoy after 2021.\",\n",
              " \"With just 1% each of Cabernet and Merlot, this wine is darker in color, and offers pretty while dense aromas of concentrated violet, hot brick and boysenberry juice. It's dense and grippy on the palate, but quite lively with flavors of dried blackberry, pepper spice, black slate minerality and, on the finish, semisweet chocolate.\",\n",
              " 'The flint soil of the Fiou domaine has given a magnificent rich wine. Yellow fruits, ripe citrus and beautifully perfumed acidity all contribute to a wine that is packed with flavor. The fruit is still crisply fresh and the mineral texture from the soil shows how well it will age. Drink from 2017.',\n",
              " 'Substantive in oak and weight, this concentrated, estate-grown wine is impressive in velvety texture and a savory conjuring of tobacco and black tea. Dark, brambly blackberry and dark cherry join in on the fun, providing vibrancy amid all the sophistication. Finishing with a dash of cardamom, this wine will cellar nicely through 2020.',\n",
              " 'Using fruit mostly from the Bassi Ranch property he recently acquired, Mike Sinor delivers a bright, minerally wine, with aromas of scratched grapefruit skin, orange and peach juice, burned lemons, sea salt, ripe apples and nectarines and fresh-cut herbs. Flavors of salty, lime-juice nectarines emerge once sipped, with hints of butter and white flowers.',\n",
              " 'This mountaintop winery puts much effort in single-vineyard expressions, but this blend rivals even those, with nose-tingling aromas of concentrated hibiscus and pomegranate, plus dried sour cherries and graphite. Prominent herbs like oregano, thyme and dried sage mix with eucalyptus and menthol on the palate, where soft cranberry fruit serves as backbone.',\n",
              " 'Cabernet Sauvignon (65%) takes the lead on this wine followed by Merlot (15%) and equal parts Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Aromas of high-toned dried herbs, flowers, black currant, coffee and barrel spices lead to densely packed black fruit flavors that need time to strut their stuff. Drink after 2021.',\n",
              " 'This is a fun discovery, a tantalizing mix of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay grown from estate vineyards in cool, acid-driven sites within the appellation ideal for sparkling. Light pink and gold in color, it celebrates the tangy flavors of pomegranate, strawberry and grapefruit against a mineral-laden backdrop and remarkable depth.',\n",
              " \"Earthy and meaty, with aromas of dark cherry, plum and a whiff of volatility. Once things settle, it evolves into a full and flowing, semigeneric red with earnest grape and blackberry flavors along with cola. While it's hard to peg this as varietal Syrah, it's well made, balanced and full. Good for folks who like full-bodied wines.\",\n",
              " 'This joins the happily increasing ranks of Oregon Pinots under $20 that can successfully compete with entry-level bottles from New Zealand, California and Burgundy. Grounded in varietal character, it brings tart red fruits, berries, cherries and loamy earth into play; the acids are plentiful and the wine does not overreach. Flavors are true and lingering, with suggestions of gunmetal and iron ore adding interest to the finish.',\n",
              " \"Evidence of a warm vintage is sketched on the bouquet. Aromas of raisin, black licorice and mocha are quite sweet. The palate is wide and mildly tannic, with earthy, oaky black cherry and raspberry flavors. For a ripe wine with significant extraction, it's well balanced. But all along there's a hint of prune that tells you it's ripe and ready.\",\n",
              " \"Classic Weinert wine; meaning it's well-aged, mature and sort of throwback. It's not purple and saturated and sticky; instead it's medium-weight and a touch scratchy, with roasted berry aromas followed by dry cherry, raspberry and plum flavors. A touch of burnt brown sugar offers balance and sweetness, and as a whole it seems ready to drink.\",\n",
              " \"It's toasty and lush with the scents and flavors of roasted walnuts and butterscotch; not a bad thing by any means. Under the sweet oak are flavors of berry, tart and fresh as if just-picked. This is a thoroughly delightful bottle and a rare find at this price—a Pinot Noir that can be enjoyed immediately but should cellar well for up to a decade.\",\n",
              " \"Ken Wright produces more than a dozen single-vineyard Pinots in any given vintage. This wine, which sells for a fraction of the cost of those wines, uses many of the same grapes. It's an astonishing value, lushly fruited, tangy and laced with appealing minerality. The mix of red fruits, earth, acid and mineral is a perfect encapsulation of the pricier cuvées' strengths.\",\n",
              " \"Part of King Estate's ambitious Limited Edition program for Pinot Gris, this is packaged in a hock bottle with a label styled for a European look. Slightly off dry, with residual sugar just below one percent, it's lovely with honey, tea, lemon cake and ripe, semitropical fruit flavors. Great focus and balance are in play, with perfect acidity.\",\n",
              " \"Hooray for Shea—a shining star in this difficult vintage. Give it a good sniff and note the wood smoke, cedar and bacon scents rising from the glass. Fruit flavors tumble after, a complex mix of fig, berry and black cherry, with a streak of cola. It's lively and lingering—drink now or cellar until 2024.\",\n",
              " \"This is a crisp, dry, and very tangy wine blended from Tocai Friulano, Pinot Blanc and Pinot Grigio. It sizzles with lemon, lime and green-apple flavors. While barrel fermented, it's not obviously oaky and seems to get its energy from high acidity instead. It will be brilliant with simply prepared shellfish, fried chicken or as a palate charger before a meal.\",\n",
              " 'This bottling is fruit-forward on the nose with aromas of black currant and black plum, but the touches of dark chocolate and roasted game provide depth. It tightens up on the sip, where the blackberry-jam elements are enhanced by vanilla and milk chocolate shavings. The tannins are present but soft, and the acidity is decent, making for a very drinkable expression.',\n",
              " 'Traces of charred oak in the aroma and a flood of extremely ripe dark-fruit flavors come with a sense of depth and concentration in this full-bodied, very firm and tannic but nevertheless polished wine. This is higher in alcohol than the last two vintages reviewed. It will benefit from more age or a high-protein pairing.',\n",
              " 'The gold color and buttery flavors give this wine a rich personality for such a low-alcohol level and for a varietal that is often crisp and light. Almost mainstream in style compared to most D&G offerings, it has vanilla, pear and almond to add complexity and a smooth broad texture that soothes the palate.',\n",
              " \"Impressively thick and dark for Joey Tensley's new entry-level brand, this wine's deep and dark aromas of slate-flecked soil makes for a very earthy impression on the nose, along with expected hints of tar, purple flowers and boysenberry. Condensed cassis flavors show on the sip along with hints of lavender and blueberry, laced together by soft tannins and an upright acidity.\",\n",
              " 'This longtime winemaking family uses an old-style label on this bottling of the classic Italian grape, which spent 24 months on American oak. Rusty bloody aromas of cranberry, peppercorn and carnation lead into a palate framed by stiff tannins and strong acidity. Red-fruit flavors mix with woody spice, and the finish is sticky, showing that this wine is still very young.',\n",
              " 'Good but a step down from recent vintages. Big and brawny on the nose, with oak-based aromas of shoe polish, chocolate mint chips and mocha. The thick palate is deep, raisiny and chunky, with roasted black fruit flavors touched up by chocolate. Very good and likable, but not as thorough and alluring as it has been. 40% Malbec with 30% each Cabernet and Merlot.',\n",
              " 'A little sweet and candied on the nose but there are also floral aromas that are alluring. The palate is plump but offers good balance and structure, while the flavors run toward beefy dark berry fruit, spice and chocolate. Long, deep and roasted on the finish. Quite good for ten bucks.',\n",
              " \"From Freixenet, this is perfectly good yet familiar, which for $15 is about as good as we can expect. The palate is juicy and also smooth, with red berry, tomato and herbal flavors. There's good depth and balance throughout, and the finish rounds into form and closes things out in a tasty, subdued fashion.\",\n",
              " \"Rich and spicy, this 90% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon from 10 acres generous and ripe, with warm tannins and a fruity, red berry character. This blend has attractive acidity and spicy flavors from the combination of wood and stainless-steel aging. This is only the second vintage from enologist Jean-Rémi Larrat's own property. It is worth aging, so drink from 2017.\",\n",
              " 'Lush in brambly blackberry, this classic Zinfandel comes from a cooler area than usual, the Russian River Valley, which manages to retain small plantings of the variety amid the larger seas of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. Spicy, the wine is balanced and fairly elegant, medium in body and weight while still packing a punch.',\n",
              " \"A big, soulful wine, this has slightly funky, earthy aromas that include tilled soil, truffle, leather, underbrush and mature black fruit. The fleshy palate delivers ripe black cherry, juicy raspberry, white pepper, cinnamon, vanilla and a touch of mocha. It's structured, with tightly woven tannins that need time to soften. Drink after 2016.\",\n",
              " 'In this vintage, the winery stays true to its reputation for making balanced, more restrained Cabernet, offering firm, structured tannins and bright cassis and blackberry around a deft sprinkling of dried herb. Built to age through 2025, it is equally enjoyable now, after a decant. Small percentages of Merlot, Petit Verdot and Malbec factor in.',\n",
              " 'All the Brick House wines are certified organic and Biodynamic. Les Dijonnais spent 15 months in 30% new French oak. The opening aromas lead with fresh, lively, buoyant notes of cherry fruit. With more exposure to air its tannins get a bit chewy, and the wine shows impressive strength through a long finish.',\n",
              " 'Monastrell (with 30% Cabernet Sauvignon) has rarely smelled this perfumed, rich and inviting. This is an ultraripe Levante bruiser, with a jammy yet defined structure and huge flavors of baked blackberry, exotic spice, dusty mineral and toasty oak. Herbs, espresso and toast flavors propel this rich red to a lush finish. Drink through 2017.',\n",
              " 'Toasted bread crust, citrus and apple are just some of the aromas that characterize this lovely sparkler. A blanc de noirs made with 100% Pinot Nero, it offers a vibrant palate that delivers nectarine, roasted almond, pastry cream and mineral alongside persistent bubbles and fresh acidity. It also boasts enough structure to age for several years. Drink through 2017.',\n",
              " 'Billy Wathen and Dick Dore pick this cofermented blend of 85% Syrah and 15% Viognier together on the same day. The result is very savory, with resinous herbs and root beer on the nose. Once sipped, a rainbow of dark flavors emerges: chopped Italian herbs, creosote, black olive, fennel, soy and orange pith, reminiscent of a North African tagine.',\n",
              " \"One of the many vintners proud of their forthcoming Willow Creek District appellation, Bob and Jo-Ann Dunning's Chardonnay presents delicate aromas of yellow flowers, vanilla bean, peach skin and limestone. The white rocks extend to the palate, picking up nectarine elements, too, creating a lean but flavorful wine that's refreshing enough to sip all night.\",\n",
              " 'Bold flavors and a graceful mouthfeel come together in this classic, complex and well-balanced red, made from 71% Zinfandel with other traditional California varieties. The blackberry, sage and ever-so-slightly earthy aromas continue through the flavors, where they interlace with firm tannins and supportive acidity. This could easily improve through 2019.',\n",
              " 'Aromas of underbrush, leather, truffle and a balsamic note lead the nose on this lush wine. On the concentrated palate, ripe plum and blackberry take center stage while notes of vanilla, mocha, licorice and clove play supporting roles. Velvety tannins generate a smooth texture and make it extremely approachable. Drink through 2019.',\n",
              " 'This blend of 43% Syrah, 31% Mourvèdre, 23%  Grenache and 3% Alicante Bouschet opens with an elegant and nuanced nose, featuring scents of blackberry crumble, lilac and other purple flowers. The tart, earthy flavors combine black raspberry and vanilla with beet root, black earth and sagebrush. A deep, heady blend.',\n",
              " 'Wildly complex aromas show on this blend of 72% Grenache, 16% Mourvèdre, 10% Tempranillo and 2% Alicante Bouschet. Ripe raspberry and eucalyptus run into notes of soy sauce and dried lilac. Flavors lean toward purple fruit and ripe raspberry, with bergamot and pencil lead working their way in as well.',\n",
              " \"Joe Barton, who's made Grey Wolf wines since 1994, launched this brand inspired by pop songs in 2011. This Counting Crows ode delivers aromas of raspberry-laced black tea, clove and cardamom. It's soft and inviting on the palate, with anise, mocha and blackberry flavors that finish with a wash of tobacco. It was still quite tight after hours of being opened, perhaps due to the 35% whole cluster maceration. Drink 2017–2023.\",\n",
